									<p align="justify" class="content_font"><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deep learning provides state-of-the-art biometrics solutions when training and testing data share similar distributions and the number of training samples is sufficiently larger. The deep-learning-based solutions are mathematically intractable due to the non-convex optimization nature. Furthermore, their robustness is a main concern. To search for effective and explainable biometrics solutions is challenging yet essential. In this talk, I will present a path towards this direction and provide preliminary results using face recognition as an example. Instead of treating computational neurons as hidden units whose parameters are determined by end-to-end optimization, we interpret computational neurons as dimension reduction units, which are derived from the statistics of input data, and the non-linear activation operation as a rectifier used to resolve the sign confusion problem. Multiple convolutional layers are viewed as the cascade of multiple Saab (Subspace approximation with adjusted bias) transforms, and Saab coefficients can be used as features for decision making. We apply and compare several classifiers (e.g., the Support Vector Machine, the Least-Squared Regression and the Random Forest) in the high-dimensional feature space to achieve the face recognition task. Finally, insights will be drawn from this pioneering endeavor.</p>

									<p align="justify" class="content_font"><strong>Abstract: </strong>Biometrics has made amazing progress in its (relatively) short history. This speaker started his research in 1984, on face recognition, before it was even called biometrics. Then, computers were slow and memory was expensive, but we showed that identification was indeed possible. Fast forward to now, when computers are fast and memory is cheap: with modern tools we can now produce a laboratory system which can achieve recognition, and in an afternoon. Biometrics helps the lives of most people on this planet by its virtues of speed and convenience. So it is time to take stock on our progress. As biometrics researchers, where are we going, and where should we go? Deep learning has enabled fast and accurate processes but we need to learn more of the underlying science. Can we deploy this capability for identification elsewhere, say forensic science? Is the underlying question what is identity and what does it imply? This talk will aim to introduce these questions, in the context of my own work on gait and soft biometrics, though the solutions and answers remain for future work.</p>
									<p align="justify" class="content_font"><strong>Biography: </strong>Mark Nixon is currently the President of the IEEE Biometrics Council and Vice Chair IEEE PSPB. He is a Fellow of the IET, Fellow of the IAPR (for services to biometrics and computer vision) and the Distinguished Fellow of the BMVA 2015. Also, he is the Professor in Computer Vision at the School of Electronics and Computer Science. His research interests are in image processing and computer vision. His team have helped to develop new techniques for static and moving shape extraction (both parametric and non-parametric) which have found application in automatic face and automatic gait recognition and in medical image analysis. They were early workers in face recognition, later came to pioneer gait recognition and later joined the pioneers of ear biometrics, and currently they are working on soft biometrics where they recognize people by human attributes.</p>

									<p align="justify" class="content_font"><strong>Abstract: </strong>Face recognition technology has been successfully deployed in many practical applications, ranging from mobile devise logon to law enforcement domain. Electronic payment using face recognition was also selected as one of the ten breakthrough technologies by MIT Technology Review 2017. With the increasing of practical face biometrics applications, face recognition system security becomes a public concerns. In particular, it is important to study whether face recognition system can be spoofed by fake faces. This is called anti-spoofing. At the Black Hat Conference 2019, it was demonstrated the weakness and threat of Apple’s FaceID face recognition on mobile devices. In this talk, I will give an overview on different face presentation attacks (a.k.a face anti-spoofing), namely image, video and 3D mask. After that, I will share some of our recent research results in face anti-spoofing.  </p>
